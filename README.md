# Health Symptom Checker Tool

## Overview

The **Health Symptom Checker Tool** is a beginner-friendly, offline Python command-line application designed to help users perform basic health self-assessments by entering symptoms and receiving likely conditions. This tool does **not replace** professional medical advice, but serves as an early indicator to seek timely care.

## Why We Built This

In Rwanda and similar regions, many people delay seeking treatment because they don't realize their symptoms could signal a serious illness. For example, someone with a headache might assume itâ€™s from stress, when it could be something more serious like malaria or meningitis. Our app helps close this awareness gap.
